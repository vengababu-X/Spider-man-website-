      <h1>DUALITY</h1>
      <p>
        Spider-Man’s life was never simple.  
        Power came with responsibility,  
        and every choice had a cost.

    <h2>The Life of Spider-Man</h2>
    <p>
      Peter Parker was never meant to be a hero.  
      He was an ordinary person forced into an extraordinary role.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life is a constant balance between two worlds:  
      the person he wants to be and the hero the world needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strength gave him purpose, but sacrifice shaped his character.
      Every victory came with loss, and every decision demanded courage.

    <p>
      Inspired by the idea of duality —  
      balancing ambition, responsibility, and growth.
